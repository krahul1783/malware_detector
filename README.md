# Malware Detection Using Machine Learning
# Objective
As stated before, Malware detectors that are based on signatures can perform well on previously-known malware, that was already discovered by some anti-virus vendors. However, it is unable to detect polymorphic malware, that has the ability to change its signatures, as well as new malware, for which signatures have not been created yet. In turn, the accuracy of heuristics-based detectors is not always sufficient for adequate detection, resulting in a lot of false positives and false negatives. (Baskaran and Ralescu 2016). The need for the new detection methods is dictated by the high spreading rate of polymorphic viruses.
